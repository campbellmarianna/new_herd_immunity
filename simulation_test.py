Pseudocode:
What do we want to test? We want to test to see if the time counter is greater
than zero so we create a population that passes the edge cases and causes
_simulation_should_continue to return True. So, that means when the person is
alive and not vaccinated the simulation will continue so we want to create a
population like that.
